Scientific notation vs. constant e
----------------------------------
The parser supports both scientific notation and the constant e.

- "10e" is treated as 10 * e (implicit multiplication with the constant).
- "10e+0" (no space) is treated as scientific notation (10e+0 == 10).
- "10e + 0" (with spaces) is treated as 10 * e + 0 (implicit multiplication),
  which evaluates to about 27.18.

Whitespace matters for this case because it affects tokenization. If you want
the constant e, use spaces or an explicit multiply or parantheses.
