Scientific notation vs. constant e
----------------------------------
The parser supports both scientific notation and the constant e.

- "10e" is treated as 10 * e (implicit multiplication with the constant).
- "10e+0" (no space) is treated as scientific notation (10e+0 == 10).
- "10e + 0" (with spaces) is treated as 10 * e + 0 (implicit multiplication),
  which evaluates to about 27.18.

Whitespace matters for this case because it affects tokenization. If you want
the constant e, use spaces or an explicit multiply or parantheses.


Unary Minus
-----------
Unary minus is a prefix operator that toggles the sign of the last number.
Repeated presses do not stack; the sign flips back and forth.

Unary minus has lower precedence than power/root. That means it applies after
those operations unless you add parentheses.

- "- 4 + 2" -> -2
- "- 4 ⌄ 2" -> -(4 ⌄ 2) -> -2
- "(-4) ⌄ 2" makes the base negative -> 2i

Use parentheses to bind the minus to a single number or sub-expression.
